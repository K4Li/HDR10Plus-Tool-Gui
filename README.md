# HDR10Plus-Parser-Tool
A basic GUI to parse MKV, TS, MP4, and HEVC HDR10+ dynamic metadata to .json

Program only supports the above formats for now, I will add support for more if I come across any.

Feel free to put an issue on the tracker here if the program should but doesn't support an input extension type

In the menu at the top, you can select automatic or debug:

Automatic closes the CLI automatically when it's done as well as minimizes the amount of information in the CLI window
Debug will leave it open in order to read errors in the event you have one
